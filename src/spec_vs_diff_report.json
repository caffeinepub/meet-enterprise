  "summary": "Core requested login UX changes appear implemented: /account/login now offers Google button + phone form + guest option, frontend-only session state is stored in sessionStorage and used to determine signed-in state, navigation after sign-in goes to /profile, and sign-out clears session state and returns to signed-out experience. Account/RequireAuth copy and routing were updated to match the new Google/phone wording.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest did not ask to add an in-app browser blocker or detection logic; it only requested replacing Internet Identity UI with simple Google/phone UI and session behavior.",
